    "## Explanations for the hyperparameters and their potential alternative values\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Learning Rate (alpha)**\n",
    "- Purpose: The learning rate controls how much new information overrides old information. A value closer to 1 prioritizes new information, while a value closer to 0 prioritizes previously learned information.\n",
    "- Current Value: 0.8\n",
    "- Alternative Values: 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.9\n",
    "  * Low Values (0.1 - 0.3): Slower learning, retaining old knowledge longer. The system is more stable, but adapts slower to new states.\n",
    "  * High Values (0.9): Faster learning with more weight given to new information. This may lead to instability or overfitting, as old knowledge gets overridden too quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Discount Factor (gamma)**\n",
    "- Purpose: The discount factor determines the importance of future rewards. A gamma close to 0 emphasizes immediate rewards, while a gamma close to 1 emphasizes long-term rewards.\n",
    "- Current Value: 0.95\n",
    "- Alternative Values: 0.6, 0.7, 0.9, 0.99\n",
    "   * Low Values (0.6 - 0.7): Focuses more on short-term rewards, which may lead to faster solutions but less strategic long-term planning.\n",
    "   * High Values (0.99): Puts more weight on long-term rewards, leading to deeper strategies, but the agent may take longer to converge on a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Exploration Rate (epsilon)**\n",
    "- Purpose: Epsilon controls the balance between exploration (random actions) and exploitation (choosing the best-known action). High epsilon encourages exploration, while low epsilon favors exploitation.\n",
    "- Current Value: 1.0\n",
    "- Alternative Values: 0.1, 0.5, 0.9 (initial value)\n",
    "   * Low Values (0.1 - 0.5): The agent explores less and relies more on the learned policy. If exploration is too low initially, the agent may miss optimal strategies.\n",
    "   * High Values (0.9 - 1.0): The agent explores more, which may lead to learning a more complete strategy but could slow down convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Max Epsilon**\n",
    "- Purpose: Determines the initial maximum value of epsilon, dictating how much exploration is allowed at the start.\n",
    "Current Value: 1.0\n",
    "- Alternative Values: 0.8, 0.9, 0.95\n",
    "   * High Max Epsilon (0.9 - 1.0): The agent acts almost entirely randomly at the beginning, exploring the environment extensively.\n",
    "   * Low Max Epsilon (0.8): A more controlled exploration process, allowing the agent to gather information earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Min Epsilon**\n",
    "- Purpose: Determines the minimum value epsilon can decay to, defining when the agent stops exploring randomly.\n",
    "- Current Value: 0.01\n",
    "- Alternative Values: 0.05, 0.1, 0.001\n",
    "   * Higher Min Epsilon (0.05, 0.1): The agent retains some level of exploration throughout training, which can help avoid getting stuck in local minima.\n",
    "  * Lower Min Epsilon (0.001): The agent relies almost entirely on the learned policy, focusing on exploitation rather than exploration once epsilon reaches this level.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Decay Rate**\n",
    "- Purpose: Controls how quickly epsilon decreases during training. It determines how fast the agent shifts from exploration to exploitation.\n",
    "- Current Value: 0.005\n",
    "- Alternative Values: 0.001, 0.01, 0.02\n",
    "   * Low Decay Rate (0.001): Epsilon decreases slowly, allowing the agent to explore the environment for a longer period.\n",
    "   * High Decay Rate (0.01 - 0.02): Epsilon decreases faster, meaning the agent shifts to exploiting the learned policy earlier in the training.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Total Episodes**\n",
    "- Purpose: Defines the number of episodes the agent will train for. More episodes provide more learning opportunities.\n",
    "- Current Value: 10,000\n",
    "- Alternative Values: 1,000, 5,000, 20,000\n",
    "   * Lower Value (1,000): Shorter training, which is faster but might not allow the agent to fully learn the environment.\n",
    "   * Higher Value (20,000): Longer training, allowing for more thorough learning, but increasing the computational time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Max Steps**\n",
    "- Purpose: Defines the maximum number of steps the agent can take per episode. More steps allow for more exploration within an episode.\n",
    "- Current Value: 100\n",
    "- Alternative Values: 50, 200, 500\n",
    "   * Lower Value (50): Faster episodes, but the agent may not have enough steps to fully explore the environment in a single episode.\n",
    "   * Higher Value (200, 500): Allows the agent to take more steps and potentially explore more strategies within a single episode, but increases training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which Values to Choose?**\n",
    "- alpha and gamma are often kept between 0.8 and 1, as they provide a good balance between fast learning and focusing on future rewards.\n",
    "- epsilon should start high for exploration and then decrease over time, but the decay rate should be fine-tuned depending on the problem.\n",
    "- decay_rate and min_epsilon should be low enough to allow exploration in the early stages but encourage exploitation as the agent learns more.\n",
    "\n",
    "These values can be fine-tuned depending on your specific application, and experimentation with these values can help achieve the best performance for your reinforcement learning model."
